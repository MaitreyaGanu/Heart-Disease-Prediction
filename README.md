## Introduction

Heart disease is a critical health concern worldwide. Predicting its likelihood based on patient data can help in early detection and prevention. This project uses a logistic regression model to classify patients as having heart disease or not based on various health indicators.

## Dataset

- The dataset for this project was obtained from **Kaggle** and contains various features such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more.
- It is a clean and preprocessed dataset, suitable for classification tasks.

---

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature correlations and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Train a binary classification model to predict heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the entire project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and EDA.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
